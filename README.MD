# Roblox asset delivery server & mesh parser/converter

## Main feature is the parsemesh library that allows meshes to be converted on the fly to 2.00 mesh for older roblox clients.

By default the server runs on port 8080 I would recommended putting this behind a proxy. Feel free to use the library for whatever.

Building
```sh
cargo build --release
```
